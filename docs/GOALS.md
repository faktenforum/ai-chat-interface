# Goals

This document defines the goals and principles for our AI chat interface platform.

## Core Principles

### Usability
- The platform should be easy to use and accessible to non-technical users
- User experience should be intuitive and straightforward

### Open Source Preference
- All features should be possible exclusively with Open Source models and should be preferred
- While Open Source is the preferred path, we acknowledge that quality of results should not lag behind popular platforms like ChatGPT
- The platform should be enjoyable to use, so we won't restrict ourselves too much, but Open Source remains the preferred approach

### Feature Completeness
- As many features as LibreChat offers should be implemented
- We aim for feature parity with the base LibreChat platform

### Upstream Contributions
- Bug fixes, improvements, and features we need should be contributed upstream when possible
- We want to give back to the open source community

### Custom Development
- Custom agents and MCP servers should be developed
- We want to extend the platform with our own tools and capabilities
