* Always write code, comments and documentation in English, and ensure that only English is used in the repository.
* Always use the latest version of the dependencies and tools.
* We do not normally modify the code of projects in /dev, as we use their official images and do not build them ourselves. Exceptions are when we are working on a PR that we want to bring upstream.
* Implement everything **elegantly, sustainably, consistently, cleanly, and understandably**: minimal complexity; maintainable design and avoidance of tech debt; adherence to existing patterns, naming, and structure; readable code without cruft; self-explanatory names, logic, and documentation where non-obvious.

## Git Submodules

This project uses git submodules in `/dev` for local development and PR testing:
- `dev/librechat` - LibreChat application
- `dev/agents` - npm package for LibreChat
- `dev/rag_api` - RAG API service
- `dev/librechat-doc` - LibreChat documentation
- `dev/firecrawl` - Firecrawl web scraping service
- `dev/searxng` - SearXNG metasearch engine
- `dev/n8n` - n8n workflow automation platform
- `dev/mcp-youtube-transcript` - YouTube Transcript MCP server

Use `docker-compose.local-dev.yml` to build images from submodule sources locally. Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production (published `:latest` images) or `docker-compose.dev.yml` for dev/test (published `:dev` images). See `dev/README.md` for details.
