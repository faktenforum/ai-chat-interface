* Always write code, comments and documentation in English, and ensure that only English is used in the repository.
* Always use the latest version of the dependencies and tools.
* We do not normally modify the code of projects in /dev, as we use their official images and do not build them ourselves. Exceptions are when we are working on a PR that we want to bring upstream.

## Git Submodules

This project uses git submodules in `/dev` for local development and PR testing:
- `dev/librechat` - LibreChat application
- `dev/agents` - npm package for LibreChat
- `dev/rag_api` - RAG API service
- `dev/librechat-doc` - LibreChat documentation
- `dev/firecrawl` - Firecrawl web scraping service
- `dev/searxng` - SearXNG metasearch engine
- `dev/n8n` - n8n workflow automation platform

Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` to build images from submodule sources. Use `docker-compose.yml` for published images. See `dev/README.md` for details.
