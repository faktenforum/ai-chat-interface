# Documentation Rules

## Principles (LLM-optimised)
- **Minimal**: Document only what matters—decisions, constraints, non-obvious behaviour, integration points. Omit restatements of code or generic advice.
- **Scannable**: Use headings, lists, code blocks; avoid long prose. High signal-to-noise ratio so key facts are locatable quickly.
- **Precise**: Prefer concrete facts (paths, env vars, commands, options) over vague descriptions. One source of truth per topic.

## Language & Format
- English only (code, comments, descriptions). Markdown (.md) in `docs/`.

## Content Guidelines
- Maximise information density: essential facts only, no filler, no “nice to have” padding.
- Actionable > narrative: technical details, examples, and CLI/config snippets when they resolve ambiguity.
- Do not inflate: if one sentence suffices, do not add paragraphs. Prefer tables/lists over prose for structured data.

## File Management
- New .md → add link in `docs/README.md`. Keep `docs/README.md` as the index.
- Filenames: descriptive, scope-clearly indicated.

## Structure Standards
- Hierarchy: H1 title, H2 major sections, H3 subsections. ToC only if >3 sections.
- Code blocks: language tags; lists for enumerations and steps.
