# AI Chat Interface

A complete, standalone open-source AI chat interface platform built with LibreChat and Firecrawl. This turnkey solution provides a fully functional AI chat interface with pre-configured services, ready for deployment.

## Overview

This project is a modular Docker Compose setup that combines multiple open-source AI tools into a cohesive platform:

- **LibreChat** - Main AI chat interface with support for multiple AI models
- **Firecrawl** - Web scraping and content extraction service
- **Traefik** - Reverse proxy and load balancer
- **RAG API** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for document search
- **SearXNG** - Meta search engine for web search functionality

## Philosophy

This project is designed as a **complete, standalone open-source solution** that prioritizes:

- **Open Source First** - All features work with open-source models and tools by default
- **Feature Completeness** - Full feature parity with LibreChat and beyond
- **Ease of Use** - Intuitive and accessible to non-technical users
- **Turnkey Deployment** - Pre-configured services ready to use out of the box
- **Community Contribution** - Bug fixes and improvements contributed upstream

The platform balances open-source preference with quality, ensuring results that don't lag behind popular commercial platforms while remaining enjoyable to use.
